    "#### Problem 1: Optimal Shift Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "In the planning of monthly production for the next months a company must, in each month, operate either a normal shift or an extended shift (if it produces at all - it can also \"not produce\"). We will aim to minimize the company's payroll costs while satisfying all production requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The payroll costs of a normal shift are (all costs are in USD) 100,000 per month, and in a month that is run as a normal shift up to 6,000 units can be produced. An extended shift month costs 180,000 and allows for production of between 6,000 and 11,000 units per month. Production constraints are such that if the company produces anything at all in a particular month it must produce at least 2,000 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "A month with no production happening costs 20,000. Note here that, for either type of shift, the cost incurred is fixed by a union guarantee agreement and so is independent of the amount produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the company also incurs an cost of 100,000 each time it changes from a normal shift or a no-production shift in one month to an extended shift in the next month. No extra cost is incurred in changing the production schedule between any other types of shifts (e.g., from normal month to no production incurs 0 cost, same for going from an extended shift in one month to a normal shift in the next). This extra cost is also not inccurred when remaining in extended shift for several consecutive months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of holding stock is $20 per unit per month and is based on the stock held at the end of each month, after demand for that month has been satisfied. The initial stock is 3,000 units. However, the amount in stock at the end of the last month should also be at least 2,000 units. In the most recent month (relevant for cost of switching to extended shift) the company operated in a normal shift. The demand for the company's product in each of the months is known to be as provided in the list \"demand\" below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company wants a production plan for the next months that avoids stockouts (i.e., meets all demand), and minimizes the combined costs that are described above. Formulate and solve this problem as an integer program (optimal solution should come out as 1.82M).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: it may pay off to have up to 6 kinds of decision variables for each month: three binaries that signal the type of production (no production, normal, extended), one continuous variable for the production quantities, another continuous one for the leftover inventory at the end of a month (both of these may also be integer), and binary variables that signal whether extended production occurs in one month after normal/no production in the previous."
